This is a library written in C#, it aims to aid developers writing audio streaming software by stripping ID3 tags from an MP3 without having to download the entire MP3 onto the user's computer.

It also has the optional capacity to strip links from a webpage (screen-scraping) and sorting links which are not full MP3 links (samples etc)
